## 🚀 Quick Start / Local Development Guide

The workspace is configured beautifully using a monorepo-friendly setup with `concurrently`, enabling you to start everything from the very root folder.

### 1️⃣ Dependencies & Environments
Make sure you have MongoDB running locally, or map it to a remote database string.

Inside the `backend/` folder, ensure your `.env` looks like this:
```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/shopnest
JWT_SECRET=super_secret_key
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_key_secret
```

From the **root folder** `shopnest/`, trigger a full install across environments:
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2️⃣ Populate the Database (Seeding)
Test the platform rapidly featuring beautiful dummy products (Unsplash) and automatic `Admin` role provisioning:
```bash
npm run seed
```
> **Seed Admin Access:** Email: `admin@shopnest.com` | Password: `password123`

### 3️⃣ Run Servers Start
Run this single command at the root to bind the Backend (Port 5000) and Frontend (Port 3000) natively:
```bash
npm run dev
